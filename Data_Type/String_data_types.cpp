// String Types
// The string type is used to store a sequence of characters (text). This is not a built-in type, but it behaves like one in its most basic usage. String values must be surrounded by double quotes:

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  string greeting = "Hello";
  cout << greeting;
  return 0;
}
