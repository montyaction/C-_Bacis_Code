// C++ Multi-line Comments
// Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.

// Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by the compiler:

// Example

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    /* The code below will print the words Hello World!
    Hello World!
    to the screen, and it is amazing */
    cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}

// Single or multi-line comments?
// It is up to you which you want to use. Normally, we use // for short comments, and /* */ for longer.
