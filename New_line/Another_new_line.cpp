// Another way to insert a new line, is with the endl manipulator:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
    cout << "I am learning C++";
    return 0;
}

// Both \n and endl are used to break lines. However, \n is used more often and is the preferred way.
